Exercise Description

1. Write a Person java bean that has name, age and address as bound properties.

2. Test your Person javabean in a small test program.

3. If the personâ€™s age is changed into an obviously wrong value (like a negative value or a value greater than 141), the Person javabean must raise an event called AgeErrorEvent.
Do the necessary extensions to your program to get this to work.

4. Extend your test program to test for the AgeErrorEvent too.

5. Add a constrained property creditLimit to the Person javabean.

6. Extend the test program to test that the constrained property is working as expected.
